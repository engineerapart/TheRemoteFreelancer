# The Remote Freelancer
List of community-curated resources to find topical remote freelance &amp; contract work for software developers, web designers, and more!

## Why
This repo was inspired by [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12773282) about one software developer's experience with Upwork. For all those who have had bad experiences with Upwork, I wanted to create a list of additional resources that software developers can use to find freelance, nomadic and contract work.

## Contributing
Please please please contribute to the list! If you have freelance work available, or know someone who does, feel free to open a pull request to augment this list! If PRs come in quuite regularly I'll actually bother to create a website and backend for it.

Also, if anyone would like to make a proper logo for this, I'd be eternally grateful. I whipped this one together using [VennGage](https://venngage.com).

Thank you for looking :) Good hunting!
