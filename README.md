## Why
This repo was inspired by [this Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12773282) about one software developer's experience with Upwork. For all those who have had bad experiences with Upwork, I wanted to create a list of additional resources that software developers can use to find freelance, nomadic and contract work.

## Contributing
Please please please contribute to the list! If you have freelance work available or know someone who does, feel free to open a pull request to augment this list!

Thank you for looking :) Good hunting!
